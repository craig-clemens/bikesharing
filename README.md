 ## Overview
 
Our goal here was to create a propsal that supports investment into a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. The dataset we were given was from an already highly successful program in New York City. Using this dataset we created visualizations to view the trends between gender and times-of-use. These visualizations show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each day of the week, the number of trips by gender and type of user (customer vs. subscriber), and where each trip starts and ends. 

## Results

Screenshots of our analysis are shown below:

## Summary
Although tourists do make up a fair amount of ridership, overall the most frequent users are subscribers and thus local commuters. This can be seen in a few differenct visualizations - most notably in our heatmap of subscriber vs. customer ridership. To that end, first-year marketing should be focused on getting locals to subscribe and get onto the new service. Additionally, it is clear that the most common time of use is ~5 minutes in length. Should a bike system be set up in Des Moines, the stations should be set between a 5-10 minute ride from each other.
